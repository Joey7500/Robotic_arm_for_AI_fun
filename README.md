# Robotic_arm_for_AI_fun
I am building robotic arm from scratch and having fun with camera control, micmicking learing, tic tac toe game and various commands, i am using my own mechanical design form scratch. The arm is larger than usual hobby project, controlled by higher torque servos (160 kg.cm). I am going to publish my progress in this repository together with all the code.
